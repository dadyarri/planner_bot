# Roadmap: PlannerBot

## Overview

PlannerBot is a Telegram bot for coordinating D&D game sessions across multiple campaigns within a single
Telegram supergroup that uses forum threads. Each campaign is run by a separate Dungeon Master (DM), lives in
its own forum thread, and has its own set of players and game schedule. Player availability remains **global** —
a player fills in their schedule once and that data is shared across all campaigns.

**Tech stack:** .NET 10, C#, Entity Framework Core (PostgreSQL), Telegram.Bot SDK, TickerQ (scheduled jobs),
Humanizer (Russian time-span humanization in messages).

---

## Current State (as of Phase 10)

All multi-campaign support and turn-order mechanics are implemented. Below is a summary of what is live.

### Entities

- **`User`** — `Id`, `Username`, `Name`, `IsActive`. `IsActive` is a global pause flag toggled by `/pause`/`/unpause`.
- **`Response`** — stores a user's availability for a UTC date/time: `Availability` (Yes/No/Probably/Unknown) and
  `DateTime` (nullable start time).
- **`ForumThread`** — `Id`, `ChatId`, `ThreadId`, `Name`, `IsClosed`. Tracked reactively via service messages.
- **`ServiceThread`** — marks a forum thread as administrative. Toggled by `/service_thread`.
- **`Campaign`** — `Id`, `DungeonMasterId`, `ForumThreadId`, `IsActive`, `OrderIndex`, `CreatedAt`. Name and
  chat ID derived from the linked `ForumThread`.
- **`CampaignMember`** — join table `(CampaignId, UserId, JoinedAt)`.
- **`SavedGame`** — `Id`, `DateTime` (UTC), `CampaignId`.
- **`VoteSession`** — `Id`, `ChatId`, `MessageId`, `ThreadId`, `GameDateTime`, `VoteCount`, `AgainstCount`,
  `Outcome`, `CreatedAt`, `ExpiresAt`, `CreatorId`, `CampaignId`.
- **`VoteSessionVote`** — per-user vote record (For/Against) with unique constraint on `(VoteSessionId, UserId)`.
- **`AvailableSlot`** — `Id`, `CampaignId`, `DateTime` (UTC), `ComputedAt`. Rebuilt on every `/plan` completion.
- **`CampaignOrderState`** — one row per chat; `CurrentCampaignId` tracks whose turn it is in the rotation.
- **`CampaignOrderDraft`** — one row per (UserId, ChatId); stores the in-progress `/order_set` draft.
  Deleted on save or cancel.

### Background jobs

- `expire_vote_session` — marks a vote session as Expired after 24 h.
- `send_vote_reminder` — pings non-voters after 12 h.
- `send_game_reminder` — notifies campaign members before a saved game (48 h, 24 h, 5 h, 3 h, 1 h, 10 min).
  Posted in the campaign's forum thread, mentioning the DM and all members.
- `send_weekly_voting_reminder` — Saturday cron job (global).

### Super-admin

The user with username `dadyarri` has elevated privileges:
- Can run any DM-restricted command (`/vote`, `/unsave`, `/campaign_next`) as if they were the actual DM, without changing campaign ownership.
- `/campaign_new` shows a DM picker so they can assign any active user as the DM of the new campaign.

## Possible Future Improvements

- Allow campaigns to opt out of the turn rotation individually.
- Add a `/campaign_pause` command to soft-delete a campaign (set `IsActive = false`) and automatically advance the turn.
- Persist `AvailableSlot` cache refresh timestamps per campaign so stale slots can be detected.
- Multi-language support (English in addition to Russian).
